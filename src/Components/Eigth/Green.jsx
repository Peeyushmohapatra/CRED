          trust as a virtue has consistently played an essential role in every<br/>
          great human achievement. and consistently, its importance has<br/> been
          overlooked. not just by individuals, but by entire societies. we <br/>felt
          it was time someone gave it the spotlight it deserves.<br/> especially for
          the ones who live by this virtue: the trustworthy.<br/><br/> so we thought of
          creating a system that rewards its members for<br/> doing good and being
          trustworthy. this way, trust as a virtue<br/> becomes something to aspire
          to, just the way it should be. then we<br/> went one step ahead: we built
          it. we know we are on the right<br/> track because here you are.<br/><br/> if you
          make it to CRED, congratulations and welcome. we have a<br/> lot of things
          planned for you.
